## Problem Statement

Marketing would like to increase email campaign engagement by segmenting the customer-base using their buying habbits. 

## Solution Summary

The data science team has identified 4 customer segments. The 4 customer segments were given descriptions based on the customer's top product purchases.

1. __Segment 1 Preferences:__ Road Bikes, Below $3200 (Economical Models)

2. __Segment 2 Preferences:__ Mountain Bikes, Above $3200 (Premium Models)

3. __Segment 3 Preferences:__ Road Bikes, Above $3200 (Premium Models)

4. __Segment 4 Preferences:__ Both Road and Mountain, Below $3200 (Economical Models)


## Customer Preferences

### Heat Map

Our customer-base consists of 30 bike shops.  Several customers have purchasing preferences for Road or Mountain Bikes based on the proportion of bikes purchased by category_1 and category_2.

```{r, fig.height=12}
# PLOT CUSTOMER HEAT MAP
plot_customer_heatmap(interactive = params$interactive)
```

### Customer Segmentation

This is a 2D projection based on customer similarity that exposes 4 clusters, which are key segments in the customer base.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
# PLOT CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
plot_customer_segments(k = 4, seed = 123, interactive = params$interactive)
```


### Customer Preferences By Segment

The 4 customer segments were given descriptions based on the customer's top product purchases.

1. __Segment 1 Preferences:__ Road Bikes, Below $3200 (Economical Models)

2. __Segment 2 Preferences:__ Mountain Bikes, Above $3200 (Premium Models)

3. __Segment 3 Preferences:__ Road Bikes, Above $3200 (Premium Models)

4. __Segment 4 Preferences:__ Both Road and Mountain, Below $3200 (Economical Models)


```{r, fig.height=8}
# PLOT CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR
plot_customer_behavior_by_cluster(top_n_products = 5, k =4, seed = 123, interactive = params$interactive)
```
